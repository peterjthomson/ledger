# Ledger: Source Control for Agent and Human Collaboration

A modernised git interface for macOS — view pull requests, worktrees, branches and stashes at a glance

Version control is the heart of software development. The core ledger concept behind git source control is robust and battle tested but modern tooling and interfaces have not kept up with the rapid increase in volume and velocity of code being generated by coding agents and modern software development teams empowered with AI tools. Ledger is your command & control radar for overseeing changes made by multiple local and remote coding agents.
